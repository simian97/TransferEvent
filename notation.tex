\subsection{Guide to Notation}

\begin{tabular}{p{0.2\linewidth} p{0.8\linewidth}}
$\lambda$ & wavelength of light\\
$\lambda_0$ & wavelength of light \emph{in vacuo} \\
$i, j, k, n, m$ & index of vector element, especially if used as subscript, please note that in this work indexes are often are zero-based \\

$n$ & complex refractive index \\
$\theta$ & complex angle of incidence \\
$\phi$ & complex angular phase accumulation \\
\end{tabular}

\noindent\underline{On complex valued variables:}

the real and imaginary parts of complex valued numbers in this work have the notation $a=a^{\prime}+ia^{\prime\prime}$, where $a^{\prime}$ is the real part, and $a^{\prime\prime}$ is the imaginary part.
