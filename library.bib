	abstract = {"Closed field" magnetron ({CFM}) sputtering offers a flexible and high throughput deposition process for optical coatings and thin films required in display technologies. {CFM} sputtering uses two or more different metal targets to deposit multilayers comprising a wide range of dielectrics, metals and conductive oxides. Moreover, {CFM} provides a room temperature deposition process with high ion current density, low bias voltage and reactive oxidation in the entire volume around the rotating substrate drum carrier, thereby producing films over a large surface area at high deposition rate with excellent and reproducible optical properties. Machines based on the Closed Field are scaleable to meet a range of batch and in-line size requirements. Typically, thin film thickness control to {\textless} ±1\% is accomplished simply using time, although optical monitoring can be used for more demanding applications. Fine layer thickness control and deposition of graded index layers is also assisted with a specially designed rotating shutter mechanism. This paper presents data on optical properties for {CFM} deposited optical coatings, including anti-reflection, {IR} blocker and colour control and thermal control filters, graded coatings, narrowband filters as well as conductive transparent oxides such as indium tin oxide.

	title = {High performance optical coatings deposited using closed field magnetron sputtering},
	abstract = {Magnetron sputtering has many advantages over conventional evaporation processes for the deposition of oxides, transparent conductive oxides, photovoltaic layers, carbides and nitrides for various optical applications. The sputtering process is “cold”, making it suitable for use on the widest range of substrates including temperature sensitive substrates and polymers. Moreover, the drum format provide more efficient loading for high throughput production. In contrast to previous reactive {DC} sputtering strategies the Closed Field process does not require a separate ion or plasma source for activation. Neither does it require the vacuum chamber to be separated by vacuum pumps or baffles into deposition and reaction zones. Reaction occurs on the target and all the way round the substrate carrier resulting in low absorption. The use of the Closed Field and unbalanced magnetrons creates a magnetic confinement that extends the electron mean free path leading to high ion current densities. The combination of high current densities with ion energies in the range {\textasciitilde}30 {eV} creates optimum thin film growth conditions. As a result the films are dense, spectrally stable, super smooth and low stress. This paper describes results for a wide variety of deposited films and use of an optical monitor for real time deposition control.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.tsf.2005.05.022},
	abstract = {The method of reactive gas control during reactive sputtering strongly influences the deposition rate and film properties of the compound being deposited. Flow control of the reactive gas is the simplest method, but since reactive sputtering is typically done in the compound or poisoned mode of the target, the deposition rate is low compared to the rate from the elemental target. In addition, the film properties produced by flow control reactive sputtering are less than optimal. Partial pressure control of the reactive gas is more complex than flow control because it requires active feedback control, but it allows operation of the process in the transition region between the elemental and poisoned states of the target. By operating in this region, higher deposition rates compared to flow control are achieved, and the film properties are improved. Reactive sputtering of insulating films requires the use of the right type of power to prevent arcing on the target, which is detrimental to the quality of the deposited films. Both pulsed dc and mid-frequency ac power prevent arcing during the reactive sputtering of insulating films. Arc prevention eliminates droplet ejection from the target and allows the reactive deposition to occur without large fluctuations in the reactive gas partial pressure, often a result of uncontrolled arcing. Ternary or quaternary compounds can be reactively sputtered using dual magnetron set-ups and multiple reactive gases. Multiple reactive gases present an additional control problem in that one of the reactive gases can trap the target in the poisoned mode unless the partial pressures of both reactive gases are individually controlled. Reactive sputtering with high power pulsed magnetron sputtering, which provides a high degree of ionization of the sputtered species, is possible for insulating films as long as the partial pressure of the reactive gas is controlled and arc detection and suppression is available on the power supply.},

	abstract = {Optical thin films are used in a wide variety of optical components. An important aspect of modern thin film design work is the use of computers to match the multilayer parameters to a set of optical specifications such as a desired reflectance curve. There are several basic approaches to the design of thin film multilayer coatings. These include graphical, analytical and digital design methods. The latter, representing both local and global minimum seeking algorithms, are particularly powerful because they lend themselves to the design of coatings with much more complicated properties than is possible with the other methods. Many traditional optimization techniques, including Simplex, Gradient, and Damped least squares method, have been used in this field. However, up to now, it has not been possible to say if one of these techniques gives the optimal solution of the problem to be solved. A genetic algorithm is introduced to search for the optimal optical thin film design. This paper discusses the problem of thin film design in greater detail. It shows how a genetic algorithm can evolve the design for better performance. Examples of designs obtained by {GA} optimization techniques are given.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study has been to compare and quantify the simulated effects of noise, index errors, and photometric level errors on four different optical monitoring layer termination strategies. A computer program to simulate optical thin film monitoring has been written for this work. These four termination methods are: photometric cut level, two types of turning point termination, and percent change from the extrema of the last maximum and minimum in the optical monitoring curve ({POEM}). The turning point termination algorithms which have been implemented are described briefly. A 4-layer antireflection coating design has been simulated to find its possibilities and limitations, and to quantify the effects. The level cut strategy works well if the noise is low and the errors in index and photometric scale are small; however, systematic errors are a problem for level cuts in the presence of index and/or photometric scale errors. All of the other strategies are insensitive to index and/or photometric scale errors. It was found that two the turning point strategies work reasonably well from the turning point to points beyond that. The {POEM} strategy is robust and insensitive to errors when it is used beyond a {\textasciitilde}5\% difference from the photometric level of the turning point.},

	abstract = {We propose a new method for a light energy ﬂux density (or irradiance) calculation in an arbitrary multilayer stack containing coherent and incoherent layers. Although the well known General Transfer-Matrix Method ({GTMM}) can be successfully used for the overall reﬂectance and transmittance calculation, it does not allow us to obtain the corresponding irradiance depth proﬁle straightforwardly. We show in this paper that subsequent phase-shift integrations over the incoherent layers result in the reﬂectance and transmittance expressions identical to those of the {GTMM} formulation. However, the alternative mathematical approach allows us to derive an analytical expression for irradiance at an arbitrary depth of the multilayer stack, thus making it possible to calculate the absorptance depth proﬁle. In fact, the {GTMM} expressions for the overall reﬂectance and transmittance turn out to be special cases of the irradiance calculation at the incident and emergent surface of the multilayer stack. Consequently, the proposed Phase-shift Integration Method ({PIM}) represents a continuous irradiance calculation model without any energy imbalances on layer interfaces. In addition, since we are able to obtain analytical layer thickness derivatives, the {PIM} is suitable for use with gradient optimization methods. We verify the method on three cases of an encapsulated bifacial heterojunction silicon ({HJ} Si) solar cell, a perovskite solar cell, and a perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell, which all consist of thin and thick layers.},

manufacture of such multilayers. First, we must be able to reproduce, sufficiently accurately, the
indices of refraction that have been used in the theoretical design. Then we must be able to control
the optical thicknesses of each layer, which necessitates measurement of the optical properties of
the multilayer during deposition. The apparatus described consists of a minicomputer coupled to a
rapid-scanning spectrometer that continuously measures the spectral profile during deposition of
each layer. The precise measurement of the evolution of the optical properties during actual
construction of a filter allows us to control layer thickness with very good accuracy. The technique
is demonstrated in the monitoring of a beam splitter made of a few layers.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel approach of including incoherent layers into an arbitrary multilayer stack and treating them using the conventional matrix methods in the waveoptics regime. The proposed “Equivalent Matrix Method” ({EMM}) calculates two phase-shift additions that totally cancel out the interference terms in front of, and behind the incoherent layer. The additions are merged into an equivalent incoherent layer propagation matrix that can be used in the standard coherent calculation. The mathematical model that we describe in the paper has three important advantages. First, the exact calculation of the phaseshift additions efficiently replaces various phase-averaging approaches normally used to deal with incoherency. Second, instead of an incoherent layer, we can use an equivalent coherent layer in a rigorous simulation using the phase-matching. Last, there is no energy imbalance error caused by wave coupling in lossy incoherent layers. We verify the proposed {EMM} against the general transfer-matrix method ({GTMM}) and the combined ray optics/wave optics model ({CROWM}) using two cases: an arbitrary multilayer structure with four incoherent glass layers, and a thin-film hydrogenated amorphous silicon solar cell. In both cases, the {EMM} yielded the same results as the {GTMM} and {CROWM}, thus confirming its regularity.},

After the war the growth continued, partly because of military needs, but much more because of other factors such as the continuing growth in general optics, the enormous expansion of the chemical industry and its need for infrared and visible analytical tools, the need for narrowband contrast enhancing ﬁlters in astronomy, and then, very signiﬁcantly, the laser.

	abstract = {The history of optical coatings is an interesting one that spans hundreds of years. The modem phase could be said to begin as long ago as the 17th Century with careful observations of colors and angular effects in thin films, but it was in the middle of the 20th Century that the subject was rapidly propelled from what had been largely peripheral to what became immediately a mainstream subject of critical importance to the development of the entire field of optics. In 1950, Florin Abelès published the text of his doctoral thesis and in it defined and demonstrated the matrix calculation techniques that we still use even in our most advanced computer programs. Until then, laborious iterative techniques had been the norm. Although the use of matrices in applying these iterative techniques had been suggested, it was Florin Abelès who developed the modem matrix method and enabled us to focus our attention in coating design on the layers of the structure rather than the interfaces. This, of course, is well understood today, because it is the method that all of us use, but at that time it was revolutionary. Since then, Florin Abelès has had a constant and major influence on the field both in terms of scientific and technical advances and in terms of the numerous students that he has educated at the University of Paris. He has been recognized in many ways and I mention particularly the award of the 1991 C. E. K. Mees Medal of the Optical Society of America. We are fortunate indeed to have someone to talk to us about the history of optical coatings who has played such an important part in creating it.},

	abstract = {The manufacture of complicated optical coatings consisting of many layers of different thicknesses can be a challenge, especially if the deposition technique does not produce dense layers. Deposition errors in a layer can affect not only the desired performance of a multilayer, but can also lead to a complete breakdown of the monitoring and control of subsequent layers. The best chance to achieve the desired optical performance of a multilayer involves deposition error compensation. In this process, the construction parameters of a completed layer are evaluated to determine if any deposition errors have occurred and then the remaining layers of the multilayer system are reoptimized to compensate for any errors made. This paper describes a versatile deposition error compensation program developed at the National Research Council of Canada for the simulation and real-time control of the manufacture of multilayers composed of dielectric or absorbing films. To model porous layers, an effective medium theory approach is used to relate the optical constants of the layer in vacuum and air to the microstructure of the layer. In the simulation mode, random errors are applied to the thickness and porosity of the layers and measurement errors are also included. The best monitoring strategy for the manufacture of a given multilayer is established on the basis of statistical information obtained from a number of these simulations. In this paper the results of calculations on the effectiveness of various monitoring strategies are presented for a sharp edge filter produced by three different physical vapor deposition methods. An extensive list of references to previous papers dealing with sources of errors during deposition is also provided.},

It is shown that in the turning value monitoring of broad-band components the most important factor is the small consistent overshoot made by experienced plant operators and that, to be effective, a pre-coating must minimize the interactions between errors caused by the successive overshoots. Techniques for predicting the magnitudes of such interactions are given.

	abstract = {The effects, on the performance of all-dielectric interference filters, of errors in the turning value method of film-thickness monitoring, are studied theoretically by both an accurate and an approximate method. It is shown that, although the potential accuracy of the method in monitoring a single layer is very poor, the theoretical accuracy of peak frequency and the overall performance of complete narrow-band filters are extremely good. Poor performance of real production filters is therefore unlikely to be due to an inherent limitation of the method, but rather to a faulty application of it, or to other factors unconnected with the monitoring method.},

	abstract = {Modern design tools allow solving a wide set of the most challenging multilayer design problems, but they require a deep knowledge of synthesis methods, and good expertise in applying various design tricks to obtain a good solution. During the last two decades computational performance of modern computers allows one to consider more computationally demanding approaches, including those ones based on deep search methods. Deep search approaches require enumeration of all possibilities on each iteration of a method. The number of different possibilities (layer insertion locations for the needle optimization, layer boundaries for the gradual evolution iteration, layer number for the design cleaner, etc.) is growing with the complexity of the coating. Therefore, the computational time of any deep search method considering all possibilities is also growing dramatically. To mitigate this challenge, we propose to use self-adapting algorithms accumulating information on main computational metrics (the numbers of required iterations, the evolution of merit functions versus iteration, the behavior of the merit function gradient norm). Accumulated information can be efficiently used to complete the computations of promising variants and to interrupt iterations of unfavorable variants very early. Proposed self-adapting and self-learning method serves as a superstructure upon well-known multilayer optimization methods, such as needle optimization, gradual evolution, design cleaner, etc. A huge advantage of the new self-learning method is that it does not require any careful fine tuning during computations. New method can run in completely automatic mode and nevertheless provide high quality solutions of challenging design problems.},

An advanced thin-film structure can consist of multiple materials with different thicknesses and numerous layers. Design and optimization of complex thin-film structures with multiple variables is a computationally heavy problem that is still under active research. To enable fast and easy experimentation with new optimization techniques, we propose the Python package {TMM}-Fast which enables parallelized computation of reflection and transmission of light at different angles of incidence and wavelengths through the multilayer thin-film. By decreasing computational time, generating datasets for machine learning becomes feasible and evolutionary optimization can be used effectively. Additionally, the sub-package {TMM}-Torch allows to directly compute analytical gradients for local optimization by using {PyTorch} Autograd functionality. Finally, an {OpenAi} Gym environment is presented which allows the user to train reinforcement learning agents on the problem of finding multilayer thin-film configurations.},

Here, we propose a semi-automated method that allows the determination of the optimal strategy. It is based on the combination of trinary mappings to select spectral regions that are compatible with optical monitoring and the use of the reflected phase error at a single wavelength versus optical monitoring wavelength. We show how this procedure can be used for the determination of either a single optical monitoring wavelength or a multi-wavelength procedure of a complex filter and confirm these theoretical results with an experimental demonstration.},

Substantial progress was achieved by the introduction of direct monitoring on the rotating substrate holder. It is a complex task to develop a stable monitoring strategy for multilayers with a large number of layers and irregular thicknesses. The verification and improvement requires the feedback of more or less numerous real coating runs. This expensive and time consuming trial and error method can be reduced significantly by computer simulation of coating runs. A new software tool which simulates the coating process with monochromatic optical monitoring is introduced. Process instabilities are described by systematic and random errors of the deposition rate, refractive indices, etc. For the simulation of the monitoring curve real monochromatic bandwidth, signal noise, measurement frequency, etc. are taken into account. A {UV}-{IR} cut filter and a single notch filter design were simulated with virtual deposition runs. In both cases the simulation results were confirmed by real coating processes.},

	abstract = {It is known that the optical properties of dielectric quarter-wave multilayers are stationary in relation to the thickness of each layer. This property is particularly interesting for the purpose of controlling the production of such stacks. In fact, if because of inevitable production errors the thickness of the layer that has just been evaporated is not exactly equal to Λ4, the consequences of the error can be lowered considerably; it is enough to give to the following layer a thickness not equal to Λ4, in such a way that the stack optical properties will be stationary again. Obviously, this result can only be obtained if control of the thickness of each layer during evaporation is based on observation of the optical properties of the stack for the wavelength Λ. A monitoring process that allows the use of this error correction has been perfected. In addition, computer simulation of stack production allowed us to estimate the allowable tolerances. For example, we found that even for the difficult case of narrow band interference filters (Fabry-Perot or double half-wave type) the stack optical properties are not seriously affected by errors of 10\% in the thickness of each layer. The experimental results agree with our predictions.},

The sensitivity of the determination can be increased by a suitable combination of measurement quantities. Because more than the minimum amount of data can be used, sensitivity to measurement errors and the chances of obtaining multiple solutions can both be reduced. To illustrate the method optical constants are determined of {MgF}2, {ZnS}, {MgO}, Inconel, and Si films in the visible part of the spectrum and of {ITO} films in the 0.4–12.0-μm range.},

Preproduction error analysis and computational manufacturing are used to estimate potential advantages of application of indirect optical monitoring. It is then demonstrated that a key issue for realization of this advantage is accurate specification of tooling factors for layer thicknesses on test glasses. The tooling factors are precalibrated using single layer depositions and then are corrected using results of reverse engineering for the first production run. It is found that a gradual variation of tooling factors of low index layers is the main error factor in the first deposition run. Finally, we redeposit our coating with a modified monitoring strategy, taking into account this factor. The new experimental results show excellent correspondence with the theoretical spectral performance.},

In particular, we consider three design parameters to describe a multi-layer stack: Each layer's dielectric material and thickness as well as the total number of layers. Such a combination of both, discrete and continuous parameters is a challenging optimization problem that often requires a computationally expensive search for an optimal system design. Hence, most methods merely determine the optimal thicknesses of the system's layers. To incorporate layer material and the total number of layers as well, we propose a method that considers the stacking of consecutive layers as parameterized actions in a Markov decision process. We propose an exponentially transformed reward signal that eases policy optimization and adapt a recent variant of Q-learning for inverse design optimization. We demonstrate that our method outperforms human experts and a naive reinforcement learning algorithm concerning the achieved optical characteristics. Moreover, the learned Q-values contain information about the optical properties of multi-layer optical systems, thereby allowing physical interpretation or what-if analysis.},

            A parallel deterministic global optimization algorithm for thin-film multilayer optical coatings is developed. This algorithm enables locating a global solution to an optimization problem in this class to within a user-specified tolerance. More specifically, the algorithm is a parallel branch-and-bound method with applicable bounds on the merit function computed using Taylor models. This study is the first one, to the best of our knowledge, to attempt guaranteed global optimization of this important class of problems, thereby providing an overview and an assessment of the current state of such techniques in this domain. As a proof of concept on a small scale, the method is illustrated numerically and experimentally in the context of antireflection coatings for silicon solar cells—we design and fabricate a three-layer dielectric stack on silicon that exhibits an average reflectance of (2.53 ± 0.10)\%, weighted over a broad range of incident angles and the solar spectrum. The practicality of our approach is assessed by comparing its computational cost relative to traditional stochastic global optimization techniques which provide no guarantees on their solutions. While our method is observed to be significantly more computationally expensive, we demonstrate via our proof of concept that it is already feasible to optimize sufficiently simple practical problems at a reasonable cost, given the current accessibility of cloud computing resources. Ongoing advances in distributed computing are likely to bring more design problems within the reach of deterministic global optimization methods, yielding rigorous guaranteed solutions in the presence of practical manufacturing constraints.},

The differences depend very much on the conditions in which the deposition has been carried out. A good understanding of these differences, their causes, and the influence of deposition parameters is vital if we are to be able to improve coating quality. We have developed two complementary methods with the objective of deriving information on the index of refraction and its variation throughout the thickness of the film. Perceptible optical inhomogeneity is normally present and appreciable inhomogeneity is frequently present in thin films. Such inhomogeneity is usually associated with layer microstructure. The first is a postdeposition technique that makes use of measurements in air of the transmittance and reflectance of the layer under study over a wide wavelength region. The second, in contrast, makes use of in situ measurements, that is measurements made under vacuum and during the actual deposition of the layer. We shall show with the help of several examples that the two methods lead to results that are consistent and demonstrate the existence in deposited materials of an inherent variation of the index of refraction normal to the surface. The thermal sensitivity of the layer properties and their tendency to adsorb atmospheric moisture must be taken into account before the residual differences between the two techniques can be explained.},

	abstract = {This volume describes the increasing role of in situ optical diagnostics in thin film processing for applications ranging from fundamental science studies to process development to control during manufacturing. The key advantage of optical diagnostics in these applications is that they are usually noninvasive and nonintrusive. Optical probes of the surface, film, wafer, and gas above the wafer are described for many processes, including plasma etching, {MBE}, {MOCVD}, and rapid thermal processing. For each optical technique, the underlying principles are presented, modes of experimental implementation are described, and applications of the diagnostic in thin film processing are analyzed, with examples drawn from microelectronics and optoelectronics. Special attention is paid to real-time probing of the surface, to the noninvasive measurement of temperature, and to the use of optical probes for process control. Optical Diagnostics for Thin Film Processing is unique. No other volume explores the real-time application of optical techniques in all modes of thin film processing. The text can be used by students and those new to the topic as an introduction and review of the subject. It also serves as a comprehensive resource for engineers, technicians, researchers, and scientists already working in the field. The only volume that comprehensively explores in situ, real-time, optical probes for all types of thin film processing Useful as an introduction to the subject or as a resource handbook Covers a wide range of thin film processes including plasma etching, {MBE}, {MOCVD}, and rapid thermal processing Examples emphasize applications in microelectronics and optoelectronics Introductory chapter serves as a guide to all optical diagnostics and their applications Each chapter presents the underlying principles, experimental implementation, and applications for a specific optical diagnostic},

Today it has conquered all industrial branches needing high-quality coatings for realization of new or improvement of existing products. The magnetron cathode combines the advantages of economic deposition even on large areas and the ability to coat very temperature sensitive plastic substrates. Main problems like poor target material utilization of the planar magnetron or process instabilities during deposition of highly insulating films have been solved by many innovations during the past 30 years. Novel films with even better quality seem to be possible with “High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering ({HiPIMS})”. New attempts to increase sputter yield and thus film growth rate are “Sputter Yield Amplification ({SYA})” or sputtering from hot targets. This paper gives a brief review on important milestones of the past three decades and outlines some ongoing developments.},

We propose a method of automatic determination of the complex refractive index and thickness of a layer which includes systematic measurement of the degree of inhomogeneity which is represented by a simple model. The usefulness of the technique is demonstrated by examples that form part of an experimental study of a number of useful optical materials including Y2O3, {TiO}2, {MgF}2, {HfO}2, and {SiO}2. The dispersions of the refractive index, the extinction coefficient, and of the inhomogeneity are represented by Cauchy formulas with accurately determined coefficients. The results can therefore be readily used in computing the optical properties of thin-film multilayers.},

It demands a more robust design method than traditional Fresnel's equations. An admittance locus is a kind of optical thin film design method which has been extensively used for high performance optical coatings. We have applied this method for the design of multilayer {SPR} devices, including symmetric (glass{\textbar}Au(40nm)–[{TiO}2(20nm)–{SiO}2(20nm)]4–Au(30nm)) and asymmetric (glass{\textbar}Ag(50nm)–[{TiO}2(20nm)–{SiO}2(20nm)]4–Au(20nm)) structure. It provides a much necessary guidance for the choices of suitable optical materials, thickness, and number of layers for the intended {SPR} performance. With a 633nm light source and a {BK}7 coupling prism under water, one can shift the resonant angle toward the critical angle and have smaller half maximum band widths ({HMBW}) at (64°, 2°) and (61.52°, 0.25°) for symmetric and asymmetric designs, respectively.},

	abstract = {Nuremberg ( {NURE}-əm-burg; German: Nürnberg [ˈnʏʁnbɛʁk] ; in the local East Franconian dialect: Nämberch [ˈnɛmbɛrç]) is the largest city in Franconia, the second-largest city in the German state of Bavaria, and its 545,000 inhabitants make it the 14th-largest city in Germany. 
Nuremberg sits on the Pegnitz, which carries the name Regnitz from its confluence with the Rednitz in Fürth onwards (Pegnitz→ Regnitz→ Main→ Rhine→ North Sea), and on the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal, that connects the North Sea to the Black Sea. Lying in the Bavarian administrative region of Middle Franconia, it is the largest city and unofficial capital of the entire cultural region of Franconia. The city is surrounded on three sides by the Reichswald (de), a large forest, and in the north lies Knoblauchsland (garlic land) (de), an extensive vegetable growing area and cultural landscape. 
The city forms a continuous conurbation with the neighbouring cities of Fürth, Erlangen and Schwabach, which is the heart of an urban area region with around 1.4 million inhabitants, while the larger Nuremberg Metropolitan Region has a population of approximately 3.6 million. It is the largest city in the East Franconian dialect area (colloquially: "Franconian"; German: Fränkisch).
Nuremberg and Fürth were once connected by the Bavarian Ludwig Railway, the first steam-hauled and overall second railway opened in Germany (1835). Today, the U1 of the Nuremberg Subway, which is the first German subway with driverless, automatically moving railcars, runs along this route. Nuremberg Airport (Flughafen Nürnberg "Albrecht Dürer") is the second-busiest airport in Bavaria after Munich Airport, and the tenth-busiest airport of the country.
Institutions of higher education in Nuremberg include the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg), Germany's 11th-largest university, with campuses in Erlangen and Nuremberg and a university hospital in Erlangen (Universitätsklinikum Erlangen), Technische Hochschule Nürnberg Georg Simon Ohm, Hochschule für Musik Nürnberg and the newly founded University of Technology Nuremberg (de). The Nuremberg exhibition centre (Messe Nürnberg) is one of the biggest convention center companies in Germany and operates worldwide.
Nuremberg Castle and the city's walls, with their many towers, are among the most impressive in Europe. Staatstheater Nürnberg is one of the five Bavarian state theatres, showing operas, operettas, musicals, and ballets (main venue: Nuremberg Opera House), plays (main venue: Schauspielhaus Nürnberg), as well as concerts (main venue: Meistersingerhalle). Its orchestra, the Staatsphilharmonie Nürnberg, is Bavaria's second-largest opera orchestra after the Bavarian State Opera's Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich. Nuremberg is the birthplace of Albrecht Dürer and Johann Pachelbel. 1. {FC} Nürnberg is the most famous football club of the city and one of the most successful football clubs in Germany. Nuremberg was one of the host cities of the 2006 {FIFA} World Cup.},

Real-time broadband spectrum measurements are employed to extract the real-time thin film refraction index and thickness, and the corresponding equivalent optical admittance is thereby obtained. This monitoring method can predict the termination point of the deposition process and avoid the termination ambiguities, which generally appear with other broadband monitors. Compared to other monitoring methods, the experimental results of the proposed monitoring technique show better error compensation ability.},

Using this model, we determine the functional form of the optical absorption spectrum, focusing our analysis on the joint density of states function, which dominates the absorption spectrum over the range of photon energies we consider. Applying our optical absorption results, we then determine how the empirical measures commonly used to characterize the absorption edge of an amorphous semiconductor, such as the Tauc gap and the absorption tail breadth, are related to the parameters that characterize the underlying distribution of electronic states. We, thus, provide the experimentalist with a quantitative means of interpreting the physical significance of their optical absorption data.},
